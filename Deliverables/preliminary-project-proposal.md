# Preliminary Project Proposal

In order for a human resources department to maintain the effectiveness of its company's employees, the department itself should also be effective in performing its tasks. As such, there exists a demand for tools and solutions meant to assist human resources departments in their day to day operations. OrgSoft will be a software solution to meet that need and provide effective employee management. Similar to other existing HR software services, such as BambooHR or Ceridian, the project will be a web based system which will accommodate multiple companies and their respective employees. HR admins will register their company through an administration account with the system. The system will allow human resources departments to track and maintain needed data such as forms signed and employee reviews. The software will also allow employees to record and track their time worked and vacation time along with other HR data that concerns them.
