1.  Introduction - VERY nice work. Settle on a single name in
    sentene one. Perhaps split this into two paragraphs, with the system
    description being on its own. Split it at "Thus, at the heart....."
    and take out the "Thus".

2.  Introduction: this diagram is very top-level, but it'll work...

3.  Excellent component breakdown; consider keeping all the parts at the
    same level of detail (you don't have the same amount of detail for
    5.2.1.2 as you do for 5.2.1.1 for example)

4.  Don't forget that "will" statements are NOT numbered (example,
    5.3.1.16.1 through ....16.3 should not be numbered)

5.  requirements 5.3.1.18.1 through 5.3.1.18.5 -- make these "will"
    statements and remove the numbers, or leave them as "shall"
    statements and outdent to the same level as 5.3.1.16 (this will
    require re-numbering)

6.  Finish the Backend requirements; you left off at 5.3.2.9 with
    an ellipsis.........

7.  You need more requirements for the Backend secion. What is the
    maximum number of concurrent users? How long is "prolonged idling"?
    What are the error messages that are sent, and for what connection
    issues? What determines if a network channel is not in use? What
    information goes in the network log? How often are periodic reports
    generated?

8.  You need more requirements for the Database secion. What are the
    fields? What are the tables and relations? I can't make a database
    from what you have given me here.

9.  What is meant by having the system "troubleshoot itself" in 5.3.4.3?

10. Do you really want to delete client profile information? Won't that
    data be useful for future reports? You might just want to anonymize
    it instead.

11. What calendar software will be used to integrate with in 5.3.4.1.7?
    What email software in 5.3.4.1.8?

12. What data will be tracked over time in 5.3.4.20?

13. What are the flags to be used in 5.3.4.21? What are the
    descriptions? What roles are involved for each flag?

14. WEASEL WORDS! watch out for "easily" in 5.3.4.23 and 5.3.4.24. Also,
    define "large quantities of data" definitely.

15. Finish the section; you left off at 5.3.4.30 with
    and ellipsis.................. 16.Performance requirements: good
    work here; use colons or dashes or something to space the main
    requirement from the explanation. Example: "5.4.1 successful login
    occurs within 5 seconds - Upon entering credentials, the user..."

16. Section 5.5 -- make a more complete list here

17. Which cloud hosting service are you planning to use? Fill that in
    when you know in Section 5.5.2.

NICE JOB!
