##4.3 Project Organization

###4.3.1 Organization Structure

The project demands integration between database, front end, and back end. Because of this, the organization of our teams follows each concept. There are three teams, one for each division, and Chris Franco manages overall compatibility and success.

###4.3.2 External Interfaces

Chris, the project instigator, is the main connection to SPY. He has set up communicative applications to allow SPY staff to access our team discussions and decisions. Additionally, our team records and outlines our in-person meetings.

###4.3.3 Roles and Responsibilities

Each week the development team meets 6-7:30 on Friday evenings. On Mondays, the development team meets with SPY staff at 3:30 to demonstrate current functionality and discuss dream-design.
